This repository contains my work for the Fuzz Testing assignment. My code has been successful in detecting 7 out of the 8 bugs in the program. The input jpg images that cause the proram to crash have the nomenclature 'test-n.jpg', where n = 1,2,3,4,5,7, and 8.

To execute the fuzzer code, type the following into a Linux terminal:
```
gcc -o fuzzer_bp fuzzer_bp.c
./fuzzep_bp
```

The description of the assignment is given below:

## Programming Project 2: Fuzz Testing

This project is based on a simple jpeg to bmp format conversion open source code called ‘jpg2bmp.cpp’. 8 bugs that cause the program to crash have been manually added. When a bug is triggered, the jpg2bmp program will crash with “segmentation fault” and print out “Bug #n triggered.” in stderr where n is a number between 1 to 8 to indicate which bug has been triggered.

The executable jpg2bmp will convert the ‘cross.jpg’ image file to the ‘cross.bmp’ image file. This example cross.jpg file is a tiny (808 bytes) jpeg format image, it is used to conduct mutation-based fuzzing.
 
Fuzzing:
The goal of this project is to implement a “fuzzer”, or fuzz tester. **Fuzz testing is one way of discovering security vulnerabilities in any code that processes potentially malicious input**.
 
A mutation-based fuzzer takes a valid input (such as the included cross.jpg file) for the target program, and works by creating random mutations/changes to generate new test cases. Mutation-based fuzzers are application independent, and so you do not need to have any knowledge about input format (i.e., jpeg format) accepted by the target program.
 
Implementation:
You need to code a mutation-based fuzzer to discover as many bugs (among those 8 manually inserted bugs) as you can. Each student may implement his/her own fuzzer in the programming language(s) of their choice (such as C, C++, Perl, Java, Python), as long as the fuzzer can be executed on the department’s eustis machine.
